offensive_tradecraft: |-
  An adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices (e.g., microphones and webcams) or applications (e.g., voice and video call services) to capture audio recordings for the purpose of listening into sensitive conversations to gather information.
  Based on some research from [@svch0st](https://twitter.com/svch0st) you can to determine when and how long a process had access to the microphone of an endpoint by monitoring the following registry key
    * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CapabilityAccessManager\ConsentStore\microphone\.

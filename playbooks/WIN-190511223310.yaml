hypothesis: Adversaries might be leveraging remote powershell sessions to execute code on remote systems throughout my environment
technical_context:
offensive_tradecraft: |-
  Adversaries can use PowerShell to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code.
  In addition, it can be used to execute code remotely via Windows Remote Management (WinRM) services.
  Therefore, it is important to understand the basic artifacts left when PowerShell is used to execute code remotely via a remote powershell session.

additional_notes: |-
  * Explore the data produced in your lab environment with the analytics above and document what normal looks like from a PowerShell perspective. Then, take your findings and explore your production environment.
  * If powershell activity locally or remotely via winrm happens all the time in your environment, I suggest to categorize the data you collect by business unit or department to document profiles.
  * Layer 44 translatest to layer filter FWPM_LAYER_ALE_AUTH_RECV_ACCEPT_V4 / FWPM_LAYER_ALE_AUTH_RECV_ACCEPT_V6. This filtering layer allows for authorizing accept requests for incoming TCP connections, as well as authorizing incoming non-TCP traffic based on the first packet received. Looking for destination ports related to remote PowerShell Sessions and Layer 44 is very helpful.

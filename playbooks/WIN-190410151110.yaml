offensive_tradecraft: |-
  Adversaries can use PowerShell to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code.
  Therefore, it is important to understand the basic artifacts left when PowerShell is used in your environment.

additional_notes: |-
  * Explore the data produced in your environment with the analytics above and document what normal looks like from a PowerShell perspective.
  * If execution of PowerShell happens all the time in your environment, I suggest to categorize the data you collect by business unit to build profiles and be able to filter out potential noise.
  * You can also stack the values of the command line arguments being used. You can hash the command line arguments too and stack the values.
